# KEV'S MAZER

<br>

![Title](/img/title.png)

I've always been fascinated by the efficiency of pathfinding algorithms, and impressed by the beauty of art that these algorithms creates. So I made this visualizer hoping that others would feel the same. The project contains both graph algorithms and maze generation algorithms. [Click hereðŸš€](https://kevingao25.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/) to try! (Please open with a laptop or PC as it's not currently available for mobile device) Enjoy!

## Algorithms 

**Pathfinding algorithms**
- Dijkstra's algorithm
- A* Algorithm
- BFS (Breadth First Search)
- DFS (Depth First Search) 

**Maze Generation**
- Random Wall Generation
- Recursive Division Maze
- Vertical Maze Generation

## To-do

This app is currently at Version 1.0, there will have many more features comming up!
- Responsive layout (including mobile devices)
- Provide weights for walls
- Adapt to different grid and node size, increase the number of nodes on display
- Implement Bellman-ford, Prim's Maze generation algorithms
